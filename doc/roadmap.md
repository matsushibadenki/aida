# **AIDA Development Roadmap**

## **Phase 1: Foundational Capabilities (Implemented)**

* **Core Agents:** Planning, Coding, Testing, Debugging, Execution.  
* **Self-Correction:** Basic self-correction loop for test failures.  
* **External Knowledge:** Web search integration.  
* **Version Control:** Basic Git command execution.  
* **Code Quality:** Linting and refactoring capabilities.  
* **User Collaboration:** Interactive clarification and architecture design approval.  
* **Long-Term Memory:** Conversation history persistence.

## **Phase 2: Advanced Self-Improvement & Deeper Code Understanding**

### **1\. Meta-Cognition & Learning Loop**

* **Meta-Learning Agent:** An agent that analyzes the success/failure rates of plans generated by the PlanningAgent. It will identify patterns in failed workflows and suggest improvements to the core planning prompts, enabling AIDA to learn from its mistakes.  
* **Automated Prompt Refinement:** AIDA will automatically A/B test variations of its internal prompts (for coding, debugging, etc.) to optimize for higher quality, more efficient outputs from the LLM.  
* **Solution Knowledge Base:** Successful code patterns, architectural designs, and bug fixes will be vectorized and stored in a dedicated "knowledge base" vector store. Agents will query this base first to solve new problems, accelerating development and improving consistency.

### **2\. Advanced Code Analysis**

* **Performance Profiling Agent:** Integrates with profiling tools (e.g., cProfile) to run performance tests, analyze bottlenecks, and suggest specific code optimizations to the RefactoringAgent.  
* **Security Auditing Agent:** Utilizes Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools like bandit to automatically scan generated code for common security vulnerabilities and flag them for correction.  
* **Automated Documentation Agent:** Generates and updates user-facing documentation (README.md) and technical documentation (docstrings, code comments) based on the changes implemented during a task.

## **Phase 3: Seamless External Integration & DevOps Automation**

### **1\. API & Tool Integration**

* **API Client Generation Agent:** Can read API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger specifications) and automatically generate the necessary client-side code to interact with external services.  
* **Database Interaction Agent:** Can understand database schemas, write SQL queries, and generate basic ORM models (e.g., for SQLAlchemy).

### **2\. DevOps & Deployment Automation**

* **Containerization Agent:** Automatically generates Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files to containerize the developed application, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment.  
* **CI/CD Pipeline Agent:** Generates basic CI/CD pipeline configuration files (e.g., for GitHub Actions) that automate the linting, testing, and building processes upon code commits.  
* **Deployment Agent:** Can execute deployment scripts or interact with cloud provider CLIs (e.g., AWS, GCP) to deploy the containerized application to a staging or production environment.

## **Phase 4: Enhanced User Experience & Collaborative Development**

### **1\. Richer Interaction**

* **Web-Based GUI:** A graphical user interface that provides a visual representation of the project's file structure, a diff view for proposed code changes, and a more intuitive way to interact with AIDA.  
* **Interactive Debugging Simulation:** Allows the user to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code execution within a simulated environment, providing more control over the debugging process.

### **2\. Multi-Agent Collaboration Simulation**

* **Simulated Development Team:** For large-scale projects, AIDA can simulate a team of specialized agents (e.g., "Frontend Agent," "Backend Agent," "Database Admin Agent"). These agents will work on different parts of the application in parallel, review each other's code, and manage merge conflicts, mimicking a real-world agile development team.
